### Target archery

Target archery is the discipline of shooting at stationary circular targets set at specific distances.

Archers shoot over distances of up to 90 metres, although the standard competition distances are 70 metres (for recurve) and 50 metres (for compound), usually at the recognisable five-colour target, consisting of 10 scoring zones and gold, red, blue, black and white rings.

It is the most well-known form of modern archery and the one used at the Olympic Games, Paralympic Games, and, for the compound competitions, at the World Games and many major international events.
