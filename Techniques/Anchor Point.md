### Summary

An anchor point is **a consistent point on the archer's face or body that is used to aim and release the arrow accurately**.

When choosing an anchor point, the key principle is to make sure it falls on the same vertical line with the aiming eye. Furthermore, when anchoring, the bow string in your sight picture needs to overlap with the projection of the arrow.

If the arrow projection does not overlap with the bow string:
* (Recurve)
	* You can tilt your head a bit towards the opposite side of the arrow projection.
	* You can always adjust the sight to cancel out the parallax. But that also means you need to readjust the sight horizontally if you change the distance.
* (Barebow) If you do [[Aiming methods in Barebow#Gap shooting|Gap shooting]] and imagine an extension line that passes the arrow in your sight picture, even if the extension line passes the target centre, the arrow may still land on the left/right.

Some additional notes for barebow shooter: typically the bow string will appear blurry and you will still be able to see the arrow behind it anyway. If you find it hard to aim this way, you may have to move the bow string in your sight picture a smidge off so you can see the arrow more clearly. When shooting short distances, the error is usually negligible. If you have a consistent anchor point, the error is also consistent and you can take it into your gap. Make sure to use imaginary extension line instead of placing the target centre directly above the arrow tip.

### Common Anchor Points

#### Chin

This is most widely used in Olympic recurve. Chin anchor point is allegedly easier to be consistent. I am yet to verify this. One benefit is it results in a steeper trajectory of the arrow which makes it the best choice for long distance shooting.

If you shoot a barebow, have a strong draw weight and shoot a short distance with instinctive [[Aiming methods in Barebow#Gap shooting|Gap shooting]], the chin anchor point becomes unpragmatic because the gap will be so huge and it is nearly impossible to be consistent. I personally use 30lbs limbs and shoot 18m distance and it simply does not work. By observing other archers, my guesstimation is it may work for 20lbs limbs or less, although it also depends on the performance of the arrows and the bow in general.

#### Corner of the Mouth

My to-go anchor point when shooting barebow. It scales well to different distances. At 18m the gap size is reasonable, and I'm not going to shoot any distance shorter than 18m.

A notable downside is when you are at full draw, your drawing arm will tend to be higher than when you use the chin anchor point. This makes it harder to retract your scapula and achieve perfect transfer to back muscles.
