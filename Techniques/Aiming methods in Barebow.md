### Gap shooting

*Gap shooting* is when you have a fixed anchor and a fixed hook poisition on the string; you will be sighting the arrow tip outside the target centre and find the gap for every distance you shoot, until you find your "point-on" distance.

Gap shooting is the more "traditional" way of aiming than [[#Stringwalking]]. However, it tends to be less accurate since it is very hard for an archer to find the consistent gap with each arrow. Some archers try to find a reference point in their sight picture that overlaps or is close to the arrow tip, and refer to that point every time. This is generally more accurate than shooting instinctively. However, the reference point has to change when shooting at a different place, or even when their standing position differs. Archers who shoot instinctively tend to be more adaptable in this case.

#### About draw weight

In Olympic recurve, it is generally advisable to have a higher draw weight if the archer can shoot comfortably for a long time without sacrificing good shooting form and process. In gap shooting in barebow, however, it is not always the case. 

When shooting a short distance, a lighter bow might sometimes help increase accuracy because it reduces the gap between the arrow tip and the target centre due to steeper trajectory of the arrow. At the same time, a lighter bow will result in larger vertical grouping of arrows. The archer may want to try different draw weights and find what best suits them. Alternatively, they can also change the arrows or the material of arrow fletching. For example, using vanes instead of feather will slow down the arrow at short distances, resulting in more pronounced curve of trajectory. Currently I have only had experience of shooting 18m. 30lbs bow + vanes is reasonable to me.
